# Description of the Project:

If the Death Star fired on the Earth

# Instructions for use:

Very Simple, just use the mouse to look around and observe the Death Star's approach upon the Earth and it firing it's devastating laser at us as 3 brave X-Wings venture to stop it whilst fending off TIE fighters in the process.

# How it works:

I just simply made the assets from simple shapes and also using Probulder to get the more complicated shapes i needed for the various parts of the ships and death star, the Earth uses a very simple rotate opbject script that has it spinning like it does every single second of every day. You the player uses the mouse to look around and witness the arrival of the all powerful Death Star.

# List of classes/assets in the project:

-Earth asset: I got it from the asset store here-(https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/free-earth-planet-the-best-planet-shader-in-the-asset-store-56841)

-Camera Look Script: I used the script from this video-(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W70n_bXp7Dc&t=2s)


# What I am most proud of in the assignment:

I am most proud of the Death Star's Laser beams that come out from the surface and form into 1 giant beam then that extends, I wasd very happy with how I managed to allign everything and getnthem to meetat a pretty singular point, but also the designs I made for the X-Wing(Both closed and oepn wings) and also the TIE fighters, I'm very happy with how they came out and think they very closely resemble the iconic Star Wars ships.

# What I learned:

I learned that making good looking and non mesy assets takes a lot of time, patience and massive trial and error, so I will definitely remember this in the futurte when I want to make more of my own assets, also this gives me massive respect to the already huge respect i give to asset and art designers in video games, how incredible they get them to eventually took a very long time and incredible patience.
